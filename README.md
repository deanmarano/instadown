This is a super tiny Markdown previewer I wrote.
I didn't want to have to learn a new editor and
thought it would be handy to be able to use *any*
editor to write Markdown. I use Vim, but you can
use any editor you want.

## Requirements

* Node and NPM
* Coffee NPM package globally installed.
* OS X (to have the browser page launch automatically)

## How To Use It

* Checkout the repo
* run `npm install`
* run `coffee app`
* A browser window will open with the contents of index.md.
Start editing this file with any editor you want. Any time
you hit save, the browser will be updated with the latest
markdown, previewed for your viewing.
